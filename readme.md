## capture screenshots on your Windows desktop and create a gif!    
    
the program in the gui folder lets you select what part of the screen to screenshot.    
this is a work-in-progress.     
    
things to do:    
- clean up gui (maybe eventually move to Qt)        
- understand how gifs work    
- can I get better quality images? different formats?    
    
thanks to ebonwheeler (https://github.com/ebonwheeler/Win32GrabScreen) for the screen capture code, and ginsweater(https://github.com/ginsweater/gif-h/blob/master/gif.h) for the gif-making code.

feel free to check out my Chrome extension that does pretty much the same thing: https://github.com/syncopika/gifCatch_extension
